<p>Event handlers in javascript can take a handler function callback, or an object.
If the object has a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">handleEvent()</code> method, that will be called when any event fires.
Debinding events works the same, pass <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.removeEventListener('some-event', this)</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>function someContext () {

    handleEvent() {
      // this will respond do any event triggered on the element
    }

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>xxd <span class="nt">-p</span> data.txt | <span class="nb">tr</span> <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="s1">'\n'</span> | <span class="nb">sed</span> <span class="s1">'s/.{2}/0x&amp;,/g'</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> obfuscated.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is my breakdown</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xxd -p data.txt</code> dumps the hex value of the data.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tr -d '\n'</code> is deleting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\n</code> on each input, it’s removing newlines.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed -E 's/.{2}/0x&amp;,/g'</code> takes the single line input and checks it against the regex.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s/.{2}/0x&amp;,/g</code> breaks down to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.{2}</code> which says match 2 of any non line-terminating character such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\n</code>
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x&amp;,</code> is then used to surround the 2 characters matched. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x</code> is the prefix, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> is the stand in for the matched characters, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,</code> is the suffix
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g</code> is the flag to run against all, not just the first match.</p>

<p>So this script it converting a multiline hexdump, into a single line, then prefixing each character pair with the the numerical constant in hex.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo '1' | xxd -p</code> outputs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">310a</code>.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">31</code> in hex <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0a</code> is end of line.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo '1' | xxd -p | tr -d '\n'</code> outputs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">310a%</code>  removing the line breaks from the hex dump.
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo '1' | xxd -p | tr -d '\n' | sed -E 's/.{2}/0x&amp;,/g'</code> outputs <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0x31,0x0a,</code></p>

<p>I found this task deeply enjoyable, hopefully my understanding is correct.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="note" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was asked to help understand the following command]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2024 Return of the personal life</title><link href="https://gregdaynes.com/post/2024/01/02/return-of-the-personal-site.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2024 Return of the personal life" /><published>2024-01-02T07:03:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-02T07:03:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gregdaynes.com/post/2024/01/02/return-of-the-personal-site</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gregdaynes.com/post/2024/01/02/return-of-the-personal-site.html"><![CDATA[<p>Happy New Year - Welcome to 2024!</p>

<p>2023 brought a lot of changes in technology, with the availability of LLM and Generative AIs for public consumption, to the <a href="https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/">enshittification</a> of everything.</p>

<p>I spent much of the year as a consultant, mostly in Shopify e-commerce, location based entertainment, interactive education, and physical literacy. After leaving my research &amp; development role within the Canadian defense industry.</p>

<p>In my work and areas of reasearch, several technical themes kept reappearing throughout 2023 - outside of AI of course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Software Maintainability</li>
  <li>Sustainable Development</li>
  <li>Fediverse and Platform Exodus</li>
  <li>Reduced role of Active-Computing</li>
</ol>

<p>While 1, 2 are self explanitory and something that will forever be a topic of discussion and professional pursuit, 3 &amp; 4 are not new, but have a renewed focus.</p>

<h3 id="fediverse-and-the-exodus---bring-on-the-indieweb">Fediverse and the Exodus - Bring on the <a href="https://indieweb.org">Indieweb</a></h3>

<p>I’m not sure I like the term indieweb, but it works for now. I’ve missed the internet of the 90s/00s, but it didn’t disappear, our attention was misplaced elsewhere. Events in 2022 and 2023 have brought the independent web back into view as some people are rebelling against centralized platforms.</p>

<p>Those platforms aren’t going to disappear anytime soon, but we can make concerted efforts to prioritize and utilize the free and open web to control our own content and publish as we see fit. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/23/23928550/posse-posting-activitypub-standard-twitter-tumblr-mastodon">POSSE</a> protocol is a good guidance for moving on in 2024.</p>

<h3 id="reduced-role-of-active-computing">Reduced role of Active Computing</h3>

<p>A subject I’ve been ruminating over this past year, is the role Active computing takes in our lives. Between deep work, or mindless doomscrolling, we’re actively engaging with computers to do things. This requires our time and attention to perform actions however menial. Computers are surprisingly good at doing things repeatedly and scheduled. So why do we need to actively engage to get what we want? Why isn’t it available for us when we think about it or pass by?</p>

<p>Phone lockscreens are one way to achieve this. It’s personal, and with you most of the time, but that comes with the mental burden of having the device with you and looking at it. Physical information dashboards like <a href="">magic mirrors</a> and <a href="">e-ink calendars</a> are potentially more appropriate for passive information.</p>

<p>Communication channels: Slack, Discord, Texting/SMS are all asynchronous communication but have certain expectations to be synchronous. This puts a burden on us to have our phones or laptops at the ready, to be willing to jump to answer any question asked. Bring back email, things can wait for a few hours, or days. Nothing needs immediate resoltion, and if it does, pick up the phone and call.</p>

<p><em>Email, I never thought I’d say I wanted more email, but here we are.</em></p>

<p>During Summer 2023, I was writing small applications that would fetch data from various services. My goal for each of these applications was to be fast, simple, and out of the way. They’re CLIs, which requires inputting the command into a terminal, and viewing the results. Fast + Simple were covered, single responsibility and ASCII output means there’s not a lot of room for feature creep and bloat.</p>

<p>But they were very much in-the-way, and required active computing.</p>

<p>Enter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cron</code>, My favourite scheduling tool from 1975. Unchanged, and unequalled for 48 years.</p>

<p><em>Did you know cron jobs will email the output of the job upon completion? Usually it’s to the local inbox on your computer, but you can configure sending to an external email address.</em></p>

<p>Pairing cron + my little CLIs, I now get emails of daily events, weather, air quality, alerts, and news without having to open separate apps, or refresh screens. I can now consume the data on my own time and schedule, that’s independent of the application.</p>

<p>This has reduced my phone use, and increased my focus on work, and life away from technology however it is still active-computing.</p>

<p>Something I haven’t explored enough yet, alert-only systems. Maybe these apps could have thresholds for when something is sent to the consumer? We use this for application monitoring when you’re network is saturated or response time exceeds 500ms, financial trading does this, so why not daily life things?</p>

<p>Schedule for the day starts earlier than usual, notification when you are getting ready for the day. Air Quality is abnormal - notification to don a mask. UV index is high and you are outside for more than a few minutes, notification put on sunscreen or seek cover. Breaking news events, aggregate and send as an email near the end of the day.</p>

<p>The last one is not actionable, it does not impact you, you can’t do anything to affect it, so move it to something you can look at when you feel like it. This is where LLMs can come in somewhat handy, rough 1-2 sentence summary of daily events, in an aggregate email. now you don’t need to check your RSS reader periodically.</p>

<p>I have more thoughts on this which I will write about as I can. If you have suggestions for apps that could be a good fit, please let me know! I’d love more of this in my life.</p>

<h3 id="where-im-going">Where I’m going</h3>

<p>Instead of resolutions for 2024, I have my goals.</p>

<p>They are to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Own my personal platforms (this website)</li>
  <li>Automate any software task that should not need my attention or instruction to complete.</li>
  <li>Read and write more emails.</li>
  <li>Put the phone down and spend time with purpose.</li>
  <li>Reduce computer usage in favour of work and play.</li>
  <li>Make an effort to use boring and low-tech computing.</li>
</ul>

<p>What are your goals for 2024?</p>

<p><em>I started out by writing a rant around Business growth, economic layoffs, Generative AIs/LLMS, burnout and lack of caring that’s causing maintainbility and sustainable softare development to fall to the wayside, but it was really just me yelling at the clouds. I’m trying to be more proactive.</em></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="post" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy New Year - Welcome to 2024!]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fellow Stagg Repair</title><link href="https://gregdaynes.com/project/2023/12/28/fellow-stagg-repair.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fellow Stagg Repair" /><published>2023-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-28T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gregdaynes.com/project/2023/12/28/fellow-stagg-repair</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gregdaynes.com/project/2023/12/28/fellow-stagg-repair.html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>

<p>The control knob on the base was not registering presses (which turn the kettle on and off). The kettle itself was working fine, and the temperature control was working.</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<p>The base is held together with 4 screws, and 8 clips. The clips are easy to release with a flathead screwdriver. The screws are hidden under the sticker on the bottom - <em>Not the rubber pads</em>.</p>

<p><em>In my looking for the screws, I removed the feet, which caused the rubber to tear. They’re easy enough to glue back on.</em></p>

<p>The rotary encoder is situated on a daughter board fixed with 2 philips screws and connected with a ribbon cable to the main board. The cable disconnects from a JST port on the mainboard, but is soldered on the daughter board.</p>

<p>Rotary Encoder Details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>5V</li>
  <li>20 pulses</li>
  <li>13mm x 14mm</li>
</ul>

<p>I used <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07T3672VK">these encoders</a> from Amazon.</p>

<p>Desoldering the rotary encoder was straight forward, I used a solder-sucker and wick to remove and prepare the pads. I did have to have fairly high temperature on my iron around 740 to get the factory solder to warm up.</p>

<p>Re-assembly is disassembly in reverse, be mindful of the thin wires routing around the center. Use a bit of Kapton tape to keep things in place.</p>

<h3 id="outcome">Outcome</h3>

<p>I can use my kettle again. I broke the display, but it works enough to not warrant a replacement base $100 USD from their parts shop, which when factored in CAD and shipping, is more than new kettle from a Canadian distributer.</p>

<p>I like my Fellow Stagg EKG Kettle, but I don’t think I will buy another Fellow product with electronics (I love the Prismo - Aeropress accessory).</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>The screws use a triangle security bit, which I didn’t have on hand, however a T-6 Torx bit worked well.</p>

<p>The LCD is fixed (more than solder joints) to the main control board, which turns out is very fragile. I managed to crack the LCD even while attempting to be gentle, I didn’t touch the board except disconnect and reconnect of the rotary daughter board connector. Beware.</p>

<p>I did not measure the stem prior to this repair, the donor rotary encoder stem was much longer. Beware of this and make sure to measure and find the appropriate stem. A long one of course workse, but the knob stands above the case now, and is easier for water to find ingress into the electronics.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="project" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Outlining repair of the base for the Stag EKG Kettle by Fellow.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hyde Decap</title><link href="https://gregdaynes.com/project/2023/12/22/hyde-decap.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hyde Decap" /><published>2023-12-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-12-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://gregdaynes.com/project/2023/12/22/hyde-decap</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://gregdaynes.com/project/2023/12/22/hyde-decap.html"><![CDATA[<p>A plugin for Jekyll that removes some of the setup and configuration when adding Decap CMS to a Jekyll site.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="preamble">Preamble</h3>

<p>These gems eschew the firmly established pattern of bundle your CSS and JS files together and serving them as single payloads.</p>

<p>This may be a bad idea in the long run, but so far, it’s been successful for the sites I’ve used them and their predecessors on.</p>

<h3 id="features">Features</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Frontmatter option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">css</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">js</code> which takes an array of file names in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/css</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/js</code> folder. Thes files are concatenated, minified and fingerprinted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Adds absolute urls to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page.css_files</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page.js_files</code> for adding link tags to the page through liquid.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Heirarchy of Layouts - with Jekyll, a page may have 0 or more layouts, in a heriarchical fasion, for example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">base.html &gt; blog.hmtl &gt; post.html &gt; page</code>
Each layout and page can have as many CSS/JS files as wanted, but will be concatenated to a single file per layout/page in the heirarchy.</p>
