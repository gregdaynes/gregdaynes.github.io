				<h1>RaceRocks 3D</h1>
				<h2>Principal Developer &bull; November 2020 - March 2023</h2>
			</hgroup>

			<div>
				<p>During my tenture with RaceRocks 3D, I lead Research &amp; Development of next-generation e-learning, and asset management with the Canadian Defense Industry. In this time, my team and I delivered practical, innovative, and cost-effective solutions ranging from maintenance scheduling systems, equipment training simulators utilizing mobile AR/VR, to rapid 3D prototyping and manufacturing techniques.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Highlights</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Maintained and advanced development of applications for logistics and maintenance planning. Creating a unique and intuitive visualization tool to quickly indicate and instruct resource management with resolution from 1 day, to decades.
						<ul>
							<li>Performance considerations were second to usability, requiring application and development of several algorithms based on Voroni and Sweepline to perform at in single digit milliseconds for hundreds of thousands of data points.</li>
							<li>Auditable operations performed on the dataset was paramount for the administration of data requiring the development of multiple interworking logging systems, IAM, and controls.</li>
							<li>Ingestion of data for a fleet of dozens of manufacturers, service providers, and end users required highly resillient data pipelines. The merging utilized pattern recognition and adaptive learning to corrolate and correct the data from sources, forwarded for review by operators to ensure correctness.
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Lead design, and implementation through the development of an advanced training management platform to create learning courses, designed to blend between traditional E-Learning on the web, to AR/VR, and motion platforms.
						<ul>
							<li>Strict regulations demand the need for advanced audit trails, from course creation, all the way down to head movements and eye tracking on elements in virtual environments. Utilizing event-sourcing data structures, every interaction in all parts of the system is tracked for analysis and review to ensure training is efficient and accurate.</li>
							<li>Performance analysis and reporting through cohort testing provided measurable feedback for review and refinement of learning material, leading to more efficient and accurate training.</li>
							<li>Data sovereignty, privacy, industry policies and regulations required careful navigation to implement correctly. Difficulties arose in choosing vendors, providers, and resulted in regular development of in-house services and tooling over common cloud offerings and off-the-shelf products.</li>

				<h1>Pixel Union</h1>
				<h2>Developer &bull; October 2019 - November 2020</h2>
			</hgroup>

			<div>
				<p>While working at Pixel Union, my primary role was as an individual contributor on the applications team, producing and maintaining apps available on the Shopify App Store. These applications varied from high performance heavy data processing apps in Elixir, high install-base noisy Node JS applications with complex frontends, and age-old laravel php applications with only a handful of installs still hanging out. Our commitment to stability and capability of the apps was paramount. During this time, Shopify also had us working closely with their internal development team to help test and steer upcoming apis and features like Post Checkout Upsells.</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>Highlights</h3>

				<ul>
					<li>Large install base in the thousands for each application required careful planning and consideration for how maintenance and deploys were undertaken. Using Standard practices for testing through integration and regression tests, smoke tests and flag driven development, we were able to deploy multiple times a day without impacting our customer's shopping experience.</li>
					<li>Organized weekly cross-companys one on one meetings to open communication and collaboration with other engineering teams working on similar domains, as well as different departments such as marketting and support. This created a collaborative, friendly environment for the company where people could lend their passion and knowledge.</li>
