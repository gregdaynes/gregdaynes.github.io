Project Hyde is a demonstration repository for assembling Jekyll built static sites.

_Note: This project has fallen by the wayside in recent years. Thought I have a renewed interest some of the systems developed. The repo has the legacy work, but future development may look different. [Github Repo](https://github.com/gregdaynes/project-hyde)_
