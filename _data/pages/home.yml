  Hi there! This is the website of [Greg Daynes](/about), and is where I collect my notes, write about projects I'm working on and try a bit of self promotion. 


  I'm a full-stack software developer from Vancouver Island, Canada. I have been working in web development since 2003, and as a hobbyist since 1996. while the web is massive, and changes every day, I love to stay on top of new developments by creating prototypes and tests to find understanding for  business, and in personal computing. You can find some of these experiments in [Projects](/projects).


  I love to discuss code, system architecture, design and learning new techniques & patterns. Please reach me with [email@gregdaynes.com](mailto:email@gregdaynes.com) or on [Bluesky @gregdaynes](https://bsky.app/profile/gregdaynes.com).
