  I'm [Greg Daynes](/about), and this space is all about my journey through the ever-shifting landscapes of code, creativity, and continuous learning. Documenting years of passion, trial, and triumph in full-stack web development.


  Join me in unraveling the stories behind the code, exploring the tools that have been my trusted companions, and diving into the exciting challenges that make our connected world run. It's not just a blog; it's a living notebook to document, learn, and grow with technology.
